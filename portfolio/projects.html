<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>About the company</h3>

<p>Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. 
    Their main focus would be to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. 
    They are mainly focused on digital marketing and they know that an analysis of their data would be fundamental if they want to continue growing.</p>
<h3>Products</h3>
    

<ul> <li style="font-size:17px"> <strong>Bellabeat app:</strong> The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px"> <strong>Leaf:</strong> Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px"> <strong>Time: </strong> This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px"> <strong>Spring:</strong> This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your hydration levels.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px"> <strong>Bellabeat membership:</strong> Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership program for users. Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalised guidance  on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.</li></ul>

<h2>Step 1: Ask</h2>
<p>The <strong>business task</strong> of this project will be to analyse smart device usage in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. We need to gain insight into how people are using these devices in order to use this information in their marketing strategy and help with the growth of the company. The key stakeholders would be:</p>
<ul> <li style="font-size:17px"> <strong>Urška Sršen:</strong> Bellabeat’s co founder and Chief Creative Officer</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px"> <strong>Sando Mur:</strong> Mathematician and Bellabeat co founder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px"><strong>Bellabeat marketing analytics team:</strong> A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analysing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the <strong>questions</strong> that should be answered by the end of this study are:</p>
<ul> <li style="font-size:17px">What are some trends in smart device usage?</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px">How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px">How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Prepare</h2>
<p>The database used in this study can be found in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit" style="font-size:17px">this database</a> </p>

    <p>These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between March and May in 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.</p>
    
    <p>This data is public and open source and can be downloaded into a .csv file. Licence, DOI and further information about the metadata can be found in <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.X9oeh3Uzaao" style="font-size:17px">Zenodo</a></p>
    
    <p>More information about the metadata and data description used can be found in the following <a href="https://www.fitabase.com/media/1930/fitabasedatadictionary102320.pdf" style="font-size:17px">PDF file</a></p>
<h4>Limitations:</h4>
<ul> <li style="font-size:17px">This data has not been collected directly by Bellabeat. Instead it is third-party data. It was collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk and sold to Fitbit. This can lower the reliability of the data and can limit this study.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px">At the same time, the number of samples can be a crucial factor for this study. The data only included thirty Fitbit users, this means that the sample size is limited and this means that these 30 users do not represent the entire population and the results might not be as useful as expected. The conclusions on this case study have limited predictive utility even if the data is trust-worthy.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px">Since the data has been collected by an external organisation, we have no way of knowing the gender of the participants in this survey. This can be a crucial element since Bellabeat is exclusively targeted towards women and some of the Fitbit users that took part in this survey might be men. The results of the analysis might not be reliable enough.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px">The data was collected in 2016, therefore it can be outdated. Some of these habits might not be relevant anymore.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px">The data has been collected in the form of surveys and this can result in less accurate and reliable data.</li>
</ul>

<h4>ROCCC:</h4>
<p>We are going to check if this data would be considered good or bad quality. A good data source is ROCCC, it is Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.</p>
<ul> <li style="font-size:17px"><strong>R</strong>eliable. This data would NOT be reliable. The sample size is too low to achieve good results.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px"><strong>O</strong>riginal. This is NOT original data since it was bought from a third-party provider such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, it was not collected by Bellabeat directly.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px"><strong>C</strong>omprehensive. It is easy to look at the metadata and see which parameters have been used in this survey.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px"><strong>C</strong>urrent. This data is NOT current since it was collected in 2016 and not updated.</li>
    <li style="font-size:17px"><strong>C</strong>ited. This is NOT known by us since it was collected from a third-party provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore this data is considered <strong>low quality data</strong> and this can influence the final result. This result can not give enough information to contribute to any marketing strategy or give good business recommendations.</p>
